Next, enter the username of the user you would like to impersonate, and click submit. If you have the correct privileges to execute the impersonate, you will be taken to the Blackboard homepage, as the user you are impersonating. Upon completion of a successful impersonate, a log entry is recorded to ensure that an audit trail is maintained:

```
"lwoods" is now impersonating "sponce_16"!
```
